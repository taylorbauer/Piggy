//  This is the page that will contain all the actual tools for
//  recording inventory.  It is called on by NewInventoryPage.

//  Right now it doesn't store the data and it is not very pretty.
//  It is more a proof of concept for once we actually decide on a
//  scheme.

//  There is an issue generating as many pickerwheels as this menu
//  currently generates.  If this list gets long enough it eventually
//  crashes.
